## II. Acknowledgment

We would like to express our deepest gratitude to Msc. Le Thanh Son and Msc. Nguyen Trung Nghia for their invaluable guidance and support throughout this course.

## III. Project structure

### 1. How to run

- **First, download packages:**
  - `cd project_net_centric >> go run main.go`
- **Pokedex feature:**
  - `cd project_net_centric/pokedexServer >> go run main.go`
  - `cd project_net_centric/pokedexClient >> go run main.go`
- **Battle feature:**
  - `cd project_net_centric/battleServer >> go run main.go`
  - `cd project_net_centric/battleClient >> go run main.go`
- **Catch feature:**
  - `cd project_net_centric/catch >> go run main.go`

### 2. Modules:

- **Handlers**
  - Handlers manage incoming requests and coordinate with repositories to fetch or manipulate data. They are responsible for the business logic.
- **Repositories**
  - Repositories handle data access and persistence. They provide methods to interact with the data source, whether it's a file system, a database, or an API.
- **Models**
  - Models define the structure of the data used in the application. They include various JSON schemas and other data representations.
- **Utilities**
  - Utility functions and helpers provide common functionality used across different application parts.
