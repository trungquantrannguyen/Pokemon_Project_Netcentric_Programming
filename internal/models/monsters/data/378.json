The effects of smelling-salts and wake-up-slap do not trigger against a doll, even if the Pokémon behind the doll has the appropriate major status effect-effect.  Multi-turn trapping moves like wrap will hit the doll for their regular damage, but the multi-turn trapping and damage effects will not activate.\n\nMoves blocked or damage absorbed by the doll do not count as hitting the user or inflicting damage for any effects that respond to such, e.g., avalanche, counter, or a rowap-berry.  magic-coat still works as normal, even against moves the doll would block.  Opposing Pokémon that damage the doll with a leech move like absorb are healed as normal.\n\nIt will also block acupressure, block, the curse effect of curse, dream-eater, embargo, flatter, gastro-acid, grudge, heal-block, leech-seed, lock-on, mean-look, mimic, mind-reader, nightmare, pain-split, psycho-shift, spider-web, sketch, swagger, switcheroo, trick, worry-seed, and yawn.

(Bit 1 is 1 if the IV is of the form `4n + 2` or `4n + 3`.  `x` is then 64 * Special Defense IV bit 1, plus 32 * Special Attack IV bit 1, etc.)\n\nPower is always between 30 and 70, inclusive.  Average power is 49.5.\n\nType is given by `y * 15 / 63`, where `y` is similar to `x` above, except constructed from bit 0.  (Bit 0 is 1 if the IV is odd.)  The result is looked up in the following table.\n\nValue | Type\n----: | --------\n    0 | fighting\n    1 | flying\n    2 | poison\n    3 | ground\n    4 | rock\n    5 | bug\n    6 | ghost\n    7 | steel\n    8 | fire\n    9 | water\n   10 | grass\n   11 | electric\n   12 | psychic\n   13 | ice\n   14 | dragon\n   15 | dark\n\nThis move thus cannot be normal.  Most other types have an equal 1/16 chance to be selected, given random IV.  However, due to the flooring used here, bug, fighting, and grass appear 5/64 of the time, and dark only 1/64 of the time.",
