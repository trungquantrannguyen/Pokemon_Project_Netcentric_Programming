The effects of smelling-salts and wake-up-slap do not trigger against a doll, even if the Pokémon behind the doll has the appropriate major status effect-effect.  Multi-turn trapping moves like wrap will hit the doll for their regular damage, but the multi-turn trapping and damage effects will not activate.\n\nMoves blocked or damage absorbed by the doll do not count as hitting the user or inflicting damage for any effects that respond to such, e.g., avalanche, counter, or a rowap-berry.  magic-coat still works as normal, even against moves the doll would block.
