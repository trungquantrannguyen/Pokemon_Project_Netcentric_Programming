If the user cannot pay the HP cost, this move will fail.\n\nThe doll takes damage as normal, using the user's stats and types, and will break when its HP reaches zero.

The effects of smelling-salts and wake-up-slap do not trigger against a doll, even if the Pokémon behind the doll has the appropriate major status effect-effect.  Multi-turn trapping moves like wrap will hit the doll for their regular damage, but the multi-turn trapping and damage effects will not activate.\n\nMoves blocked or damage absorbed by the doll do not count as hitting the user or inflicting damage for any effects that respond to such, e.g., avalanche, counter, or a rowap-berry.  magic-coat still works as normal, even against moves the doll would block.  Opposing Pokémon that damage the doll with a leech move like absorb are healed as normal.\n\nIt will also block acupressure, block, the curse effect of curse, dream-eater, embargo, flatter, gastro-acid, grudge, heal-block, leech-seed, lock-on, mean-look, mimic, mind-reader, nightmare, pain-split, psycho-shift, spider-web, sketch, swagger, switcheroo, trick, worry-seed, and yawn.  A Pokémon affected by yawn before summoning the doll will still fall to sleep.\n\nThe doll blocks intimidate, but all other abilities act as though the doll did not exist.  If the user has an ability that absorbs moves of a certain type for HP (such as volt-absorb absorbing thunder-wave), such moves will not be blocked.\n\nlife-orb and berries that cause confusion still work as normal, but their respective HP loss and confusion are absorbed/blocked by the doll.\n\nThe user is still vulnerable to damage inflicted when entering or leaving the field, such as by pursuit or spikes; however, the doll will block the poison effect of toxic-spikes.\n\nThe doll is passed on by baton-pass.
