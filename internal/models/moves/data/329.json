If the user is a lower level than the target, this move will fail.\n\nBecause this move inflicts a specific and finite amount of damage, endure still prevents the target from fainting.\n\nThe effects of lock-on, mind-reader, and no-guard still apply, as long as the user is equal or higher level than the target.  However, they will not give this move a chance to break through detect or protect.",
