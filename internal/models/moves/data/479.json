This effect removes any existing Ground immunity due to levitate, magnet-rise, or telekinesis, and causes the target's flying type to be ignored when it takes Ground damage.\n\nIf the target isn't immune to Ground damage, this move will fail.\n\nThis move can hit Pok√©mon under the effect of bounce, fly, or sky-drop, and ends the effect of Bounce or Fly.",
