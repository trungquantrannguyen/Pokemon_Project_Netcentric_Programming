  "description": "Only usable if the user is sleep.  Randomly selects and uses one of the user's other three moves.  Use of the selected move requires and costs 0 PP.\n\nThis move will not select assist, bide, bounce, chatter, copycat, dig, dive, fly, focus-punch, me-first, metronome, mirror-move, shadow-force, skull-bash, sky-attack, sky-drop, sleep-talk, solar-beam, razor-wind, or uproar.\n\nIf the selected move requires a recharge turn—i.e., one of blast-burn, frenzy-plant, giga-impact, hydro-cannon, hyper-beam, roar-of-time, or rock-wrecker—and the user is still sleep next turn, then it's forced to use this move again and pay another PP for the recharge turn.\n\nThis move cannot be copied by mirror-move, nor selected by assist, metronome, or sleep-talk.",
