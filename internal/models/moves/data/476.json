If both Pokémon on the same side of the field use this move on the same turn, the Pokémon that uses it last will become the target.\n\nThis effect takes priority over lightningrod and storm-drain.\n\nIf the user's ally switches out, opposing Pokémon may still hit it with pursuit.\n\nThis move cannot be selected by assist or metronome.",
